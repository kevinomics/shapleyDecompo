# Purpose of the package

The goal of `shapleyDecompo` is to compute the Shapley decomposition of the inequality of an outcome variable across different attributes from an econometric model.

## Overview

The package can be used to compute the Shapley decomposition from a GLM (see `?stats::glm()`), or a Tobit II model obtained with the `sampleSelection` package (see `?sampleSelection::selection()`). The package provides with a function called `shapleyDecompo()` which can be used to compute the Shapley decomposition.
